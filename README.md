# Mobile_price_prediction
## Brief Summary:

This is a kaggle machine learning project where I try to predict mobile prices using diffrent featres of diffrent these mobile telephones.
At the Beggining I start the project with Data cleaning and EDA to get A better understanding of the dataset and prepare for training the 
machine learning algorithms. 
My focus in this prject is to try diffrent methods of Data cenntric and model centric approaches and see how you can optimise the
the model for getting better result. 
All code is written in jupyter notbook to illustrate both script and result of EDA for user to get better understandig of the process. 
I include both train ad test dataset in reposetory and I'll use the train dataset for train and testing model and then use test dataset
for prediction.
